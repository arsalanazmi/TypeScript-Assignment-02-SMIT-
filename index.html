      <h2>TypeScript class hierarchy to model a vehicle rental system:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Start by creating an abstract class called Vehicle that will serve as
          the base class for all types of vehicles in the rental system.
        </li>
        <li>
          Define instance variables in the Vehicle class to store common
          properties for all vehicles, such as make, model, year, and rented.
        </li>
        <li>
          Create a constructor in the Vehicle class that takes in these
          properties as parameters and initializes them.
        </li>
        <li>
          Define accessor methods (getters) for the make, model, year, and
          rented instance variables in the Vehicle class.
        </li>
        <li>
          Define a mutator method (setter) for the rented instance variable in
          the Vehicle class.
        </li>
        <li>
          Define an abstract method called rentalRate in the Vehicle class that
          will be implemented by each subclass to provide the rental rate for
          that particular type of vehicle.
        </li>
        <li>
          Define two methods in the Vehicle class: rent() and return(). The
          rent() method should check if the vehicle is already rented and
          provide a message to the user accordingly. If the vehicle is
          available, it should set the rented instance variable to true. The
          return() method should check if the vehicle has been rented and
          provide a message to the user accordingly. If the vehicle has been
          rented, it should set the rented instance variable to false.
        </li>
        <li>
          Create subclasses of Vehicle for each type of vehicle in the rental
          system (e.g. Car, Truck, Motorcycle). Each subclass should implement
          the rentalRate method to provide the rental rate for that type of
          vehicle.
        </li>
        <li>
          Define additional instance variables and methods in the subclasses as
          needed to model the specific characteristics of each type of vehicle.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the main program, create instances of each type of vehicle and test
          the rent() and return() methods to make sure they work as expected.
        </li>
      </ol>
